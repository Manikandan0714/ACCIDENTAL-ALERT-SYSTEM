An **IoT-based Accident Alert System** that detects road accidents using sensors and sends **automated emergency alerts** 📡.  
This project demonstrates **hardware + software integration** for real-time safety applications and faster emergency response ⏱️.

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Detects accidents using IoT sensors (Gyroscopic Sensor,Smoke Sensor)  
- ✅ Triggers **real-time SMS/alert notifications** 📲  
- ✅ Seamlessly integrates **hardware (sensors + microcontroller) with software logic** ⚡  
- ✅ Reduces **response time** in critical situations ⛑️  
- ✅ Low-cost, scalable solution for 2-wheelers and vehicles 🏍️

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔹 Hardware Requirements
- IoT Sensors: ** Gyroscopic Sensor / Smoke Sensor**  
- Microcontroller: **Arduino UNO**  
- Communication Module: **GSM / Bluetooth**  
- GPS Module (for live location)  
- Power Supply (Battery Pack / USB)  

### 🔹 Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE**  
- **Embedded C** (for sensor data processing)  
- **Git** (for version control)  

⚡ How It Works
1️⃣ Sensors continuously monitor the vehicle’s motion.
2️⃣ On abnormal tilt/impact → accident detected ⚠️
3️⃣ GPS fetches the real-time location 🌍
4️⃣ GSM/WiFi module sends alert message to emergency contacts 📩
5️⃣ (Optional) Logs data to IoT dashboard for tracking 📊

## 📊 Applications
- 🏍️ Motorcycle accident detection  
- 🚗 Vehicle emergency alert system  
- ⛑️ Faster response in road accidents  
- 🏥 Integration with emergency medical services
